```
sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release
```
### Purpose:
This sed command reads the contents of the file /etc/system-release and removes the part of the line that starts with " release " and everything that follows it.

### Explanation of Each Part:
- sed: The stream editor, used for parsing and transforming text.

- 's, release .*$,,g': This is the actual substitution command using , as the delimiter (instead of the default /, which is allowed in sed).

  - s: Stands for "substitute".

  - , release .*$,: This is the pattern to match.

    - A space, then release, then another space.

    - .* matches everything after "release ".

    - $ ensures it goes to the end of the line.

  - ,,: This means replace the match with nothing (i.e., delete it).

  - g: Apply the substitution globally on each line (even though there's usually only one match per line in this case).

- /etc/system-release: The file being processed (typically contains a one-line description of the Linux distribution).

Example:
If /etc/system-release contains:
```
CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)
```
Then the command would output:
```
CentOS Linux
```
