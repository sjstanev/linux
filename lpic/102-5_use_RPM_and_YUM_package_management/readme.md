## Use Debian package management
Debian package format `(.deb)` and its package tool `(dpkg)`.
Another package management tool that is popular on Debian-based systems is the `Advanced Package Tool (apt)`, which can 
streamline many of the aspects of the installation, maintenance and removal of packages, making it much easier.

## The RPM Package Manager
The RPM Package Manager (rpm) is the essential tool for managing software packages on Red Hat-based (or derived) systems.

### Installing, Upgrading and Removing Packages
The most basic operation is to install a package, which can be done with:
```editorconfig
# rpm -i PACKAGENAME
```
Where PACKAGENAME is the name of the `.rpm` package you wish to install.

If there is a previous version of a package on the system, you can upgrade to a newer version using the `-U `parameter:
```editorconfig
# rpm -U PACKAGENAME
```
If there is no previous version of PACKAGENAME installed, then a fresh copy will be installed. 
To avoid this and **only upgrade** an installed package, use the `-F` option.
```editorconfig
# rpm -F PACKAGENAME
```
In both operations you can add the `-v` parameter to get a **verbose** output (more information is shown during the 
installation) and `-h` to get **hash signs (#)** printed as a visual aid to track installation progress. 
Multiple parameters can be combined into one, so `rpm -i -v -h `is the same as `rpm -ivh`.

To remove an installed package, pass the `-e` parameter (as in “erase”) to rpm.
```editorconfig
rpm -e wget
```
If an installed package depends on the package being removed, you will get an error message:
```editorconfig
# rpm -e unzip
error: Failed dependencies:
	/usr/bin/unzip is needed by (installed) file-roller-3.28.1-2.el7.x86_64
```

### Dealing with Dependencies
`rpm` will check if those dependencies are installed on your system, and will `fail` to install the package if they are not.
In this case, `rpm` will list what is `missing`. However it **cannot solve** dependencies by itself.
```editorconfig
# rpm -i gimp-2.8.22-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
error: Failed dependencies:
	babl(x86-64) >= 0.1.10 is needed by gimp-2:2.8.22-1.el7.x86_64
	gegl(x86-64) >= 0.2.0 is needed by gimp-2:2.8.22-1.el7.x86_64
	gimp-libs(x86-64) = 2:2.8.22-1.el7 is needed by gimp-2:2.8.22-1.el7.x86_64
	libbabl-0.1.so.0()(64bit) is needed by gimp-2:2.8.22-1.el7.x86_64
...
```
### Listing Installed Packages
To get a list of all installed packages on your system, use the `rpm -qa` **(think of “query all”)**.
```editorconfig
#  rpm -qa | head -n 5
python3-setuptools-wheel-53.0.0-13.el9.noarch
publicsuffix-list-dafsa-20210518-3.el9.noarch
pcre2-syntax-10.40-6.el9.noarch
ncurses-base-6.2-10.20210508.el9.noarch
libssh-config-0.10.4-13.el9.noarch
```
### Getting Package Information
```editorconfig
# rpm -qi gzip-1.12-1.el9.x86_64
Name        : gzip
Version     : 1.12
Release     : 1.el9
Architecture: x86_64
Install Date: Wed Mar 19 21:14:00 2025
Group       : Unspecified
Size        : 377005
License     : GPLv3+ and GFDL
Signature   : RSA/SHA256, Mon Oct 17 17:21:34 2022, Key ID d36cb86cb86b3716
Source RPM  : gzip-1.12-1.el9.src.rpm
Build Date  : Sat Oct 15 20:25:20 2022
Build Host  : x64-builder01.almalinux.org
Packager    : AlmaLinux Packaging Team <packager@almalinux.org>
Vendor      : AlmaLinux
URL         : http://www.gzip.org/
Summary     : The GNU data compression program
Description :
The gzip package contains the popular GNU gzip data compression
program. Gzipped files have a .gz extension.

Gzip should be installed on your system, because it is a
very commonly used data compression program.
```
### Get a list of what files are inside an installed package
To get a list of what files are inside an installed package use the `-ql `parameters **(think of “query list”)** 
```editorconfig
# rpm -ql gzip-1.12-1.el9.
/etc/profile.d/colorzgrep.csh
/etc/profile.d/colorzgrep.sh
/usr/bin/gunzip
/usr/bin/gzexe
[...]
```
If you wish to get information or a file listing from a **package that has not been installed yet**, 
just add the `-p` parameter to the commands above, followed by the name of the RPM file (FILENAME). 
So `rpm -qi` PACKAGENAME becomes `rpm -qip` FILENAME, and `rpm -ql` PACKAGENAME becomes `rpm -qlp` FILENAME, as shown below.

### Finding Out Which Package Owns a Specific File
To find out which installed package owns a file, use the -qf (think “query file”) followed by the full path to the file:
```editorconfig
# rpm -qf /usr/bin/unzip
unzip-6.0-19.el7.x86_64
```

## YellowDog Updater Modified
**YellowDog Updater Modified (YUM)** was originally developed as the **Yellow Dog Updater (YUP)**, a tool for package 
management on the Yellow Dog Linux distribution. Over time, it evolved to manage packages on other `RPM` based systems, 
such as Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Oracle Linux.

### Searching for Packages
In order to install a package, you need to know its name. For this you can perform a search with `yum search PATTERN`, 
where PATTERN is the name of the package you are searching for. The result is a list of packages whose **name** or 
**summary** contain the search pattern specified. 
```editorconfig
# yum search zip
Last metadata expiration check: 0:00:08 ago on Tue May  6 19:59:07 2025.
======================================================================== Name & Summary Matched: zip ========================================================================

bzip2-devel.i686 : Libraries and header files for apps which will use bzip2
bzip2-devel.x86_64 : Libraries and header files for apps which will use bzip2
[...]
```
### Installing, Upgrading and Removing Packages
To install a package using yum, use the command yum install PACKAGENAME
```editorconfig
# sudo yum install p7zip
```
To upgrade an installed package, use yum update PACKAGENAME
```editorconfig
# sudo yum update wget
```
If you omit the name of a package, you can update every package on the system for which an update is available.

To check if an update is available for a specific package, use `yum check-update PACKAGENAME`. 
```editorconfig
# sudo yum check-update wget
```
To remove an installed package, use `yum remove PACKAGENAME`
```editorconfig
# sudo yum remove zip
Dependencies resolved.

### Finding Which Package Provides a Specific File
In a previous example we showed an attempt to install the gimp image editor, which failed because of unmet dependencies.
However, `rpm` **shows which files are missing, but does not list the name of the packages that provide them**.

For example, one of the dependencies missing was **libgimpui-2.0.so.0**. To see what package provides it, 
you can use yum `whatprovides`, followed by the name of the file you are searching for:
```editorconfig
# yum whatprovides libgimpui-2.0.so.0
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * base: mirror.ufscar.br
 * epel: mirror.globo.com
 * extras: mirror.ufscar.br
 * updates: mirror.ufscar.br
2:gimp-libs-2.8.22-1.el7.i686 : GIMP libraries
Repo        : base
Matched from:
Provides    : libgimpui-2.0.so.0
```
The answer is **gimp-libs-2.8.22-1.el7.i686**. You can then install the package with the command `yum install gimp-libs`.

This also works for files already in your system. For example, if you wish to know where the file /etc/hosts came from, you can use:
```editorconfig
# yum whatprovides /etc/hosts
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * base: mirror.ufscar.br
 * epel: mirror.globo.com
 * extras: mirror.ufscar.br
 * updates: mirror.ufscar.br
setup-2.8.71-10.el7.noarch : A set of system configuration and setup files
Repo        : base
Matched from:
Filename    : /etc/hosts
```
The answer is **setup-2.8.71-10.el7.noarch**.

### Getting Information About a Package
```editorconfig
# sudo yum info firefox
Last metadata expiration check: 0:07:01 ago on Tue May  6 20:06:27 2025.

```


## Dandified YUM
DNF is the package management tool used on Fedora, and is a fork of yum. As such, many of the commands and parameters
are similar.

### Searching for packages
```editorconfig
# dnf search PATTERN
```
Where PATTERN is what you are searching for. For example, dnf search `unzip` will show all packages
that contain the word `unzip` in the name or description.

### Getting information about a package
```editorconfig
# dnf info PACKAGENAME
```

### Installing packages
```editorconfig
# dnf install PACKAGENAME
```

### Removing packages
```editorconfig
# dnf remove PACKAGENAME
```

### Upgrading packages
 to update only one package. Omit the package name to upgrade all the packages in the system.
```editorconfig
# dnf upgrade PACKAGENAME
```

### Finding out which package provides a specific file
```editorconfig
# dnf provides FILENAME
```

### Getting a list of all the packages installed in the system
```editorconfig
# dnf list --installed
```

### Listing the contents of a package
```editorconfig
# dnf repoquery -l PACKAGENAME
```


## Zypper
`Zypper` is the package management tool used on **SUSE Linux** and **OpenSUSE**. Feature-wise it is similar to **apt**
and **yum**, being able to install, update and remove packages from a system, with automated dependency resolution.

### Updating the Package Index
```editorconfig
# zypper refresh
Repository 'Non-OSS Repository' is up to date.
Repository 'Main Repository' is up to date.
Repository 'Main Update Repository' is up to date.
Repository 'Update Repository (Non-Oss)' is up to date.
All repositories have been refreshed.
```
Zypper has an `auto-refresh` feature that can be enabled on a per-repository basis, meaning that some repos may be 
refreshed automatically before a query or package installation, and others may need to be refreshed manually.
When enabled, this flag will make zypper run a refresh operation (the same as running zypper refresh) before working 
with the specified repo. This can be controlled with the`-f` and `-F` parameters of the `modifyrepo` operator:
```editorconfig
# zypper modifyrepo -F repo-non-oss
Autorefresh has been disabled for repository 'repo-non-oss'.

# zypper modifyrepo -f repo-non-oss
Autorefresh has been enabled for repository 'repo-non-oss'.
```

### Searching for Packages
```editorconfig
# zypper se gnumeric
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...

S | Name           | Summary                           | Type
--+----------------+-----------------------------------+--------
  | gnumeric       | Spreadsheet Application           | package
  | gnumeric-devel | Spreadsheet Application           | package
  | gnumeric-doc   | Documentation files for Gnumeric  | package
  | gnumeric-lang  | Translations for package gnumeric | package
```
The search operator can also be used to obtain a list of all the installed packages in the system. 
To do so, use the `-i` parameter without a package name, as in `zypper se -i`.
```editorconfig
# zypper se -i firefox
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...

S | Name                               | Summary                 | Type
--+------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------
i | MozillaFirefox                     | Mozilla Firefox Web B-> | package
i | MozillaFirefox-branding-openSUSE   | openSUSE branding of -> | package
i | MozillaFirefox-translations-common | Common translations f-> | package
```

### Installing, Upgrading and Removing Packages
### To install packages
```editorconfig
# zypper in unrar
```
### To remove a package
```editorconfig
# zypper rm unrar
```
Keep in mind that removing a package also removes any other packages that depend on it.

### Finding Which Packages Contain a Specific File
To see which packages contain a specific file, use the search operator followed by the `--provides` parameter and 
the `name of the file (or full path to it)`. For example, if you want to know which packages contain 
the file libgimpmodule-2.0.so.0 in /usr/lib64/ you would use:

```editorconfig
# zypper se --provides /usr/lib64/libgimpmodule-2.0.so.0
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...

S | Name          | Summary                                      | Type
--+---------------+----------------------------------------------+--------
i | libgimp-2_0-0 | The GNU Image Manipulation Program - Libra-> | package
```

### Getting Package Information
```editorconfig
# zypper info gimp
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...

Information for package gimp:
 -----------------------------
Repository     : Main Repository
Name           : gimp

Vendor         : openSUSE
Installed Size : 29.1 MiB
Installed      : Yes (automatically)
Status         : up-to-date
Source package : gimp-2.8.22-lp151.4.6.src
Summary        : The GNU Image Manipulation Program
Description    :
    The GIMP is an image composition and editing program, which can be
    used for creating logos and other graphics for Web pages. The GIMP
    offers many tools and filters, and provides a large image
    manipulation toolbox, including channel operations and layers,
    effects, subpixel imaging and antialiasing, and conversions, together
    with multilevel undo. The GIMP offers a scripting facility, but many
    of the included scripts rely on fonts that we cannot distribute
```


## Managing Software Repositories

### YUM

------------
For **yum** the “repos” are listed in the directory `/etc/yum.repos.d/`. Each repository is represented by a `.repo` file, 
like **CentOS-Base.repo.**
Additional, extra repositories can be added by the user by adding a `.repo `file in the directory mentioned above, 
or at the end of `/etc/yum.conf`. However, the **recommended** way to add or manage repositories is with the `yum-config-manager `tool.

To add a repository, use the `--add-repo `parameter, followed by the `URL` to a `.repo `file.
```editorconfig
# sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi.repo
Adding repo from: https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi.repo
```
To get a list of all available repositories use yum repolist all. You will get an output similar to this:
```editorconfig
# yum repolist all
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * base: mirror.ufscar.br
 * epel: mirror.globo.com
 * extras: mirror.ufscar.br
 * updates: mirror.ufscar.br
repo id                       repo name                    status
updates/7/x86_64              CentOS-7 - Updates           enabled:  2,500
updates-source/7              CentOS-7 - Updates Sources   disabled
```
disabled repositories will be ignored when installing or upgrading software. To `enable` or `disable` a repository, 
use the `yum-config-manager` utility, followed by the `repository id`.

In the output above, the **repository id** is shown on the first column **(repo id)** of each line. 
Use only the part before the first /, so the id for the CentOS-7 - Updates repo is `updates`, and not `updates/7/x86_64`.
```editorconfig
# yum-config-manager --disable updates
```
The command above will `disable` the updates repo. To `re-enable` it use:
```editorconfig
# yum-config-manager --enable updates
```
```text
NOTE:
Yum stores downloaded packages and associated metadata in a cache directory (usually /var/cache/yum). 
As the system gets upgraded and new packages are installed, this cache can get quite large. 
To clean the cache and reclaim disk space you can use the yum clean command, followed by what to clean. 
The most useful parameters are packages (yum clean packages) to delete downloaded packages 
and metadata (yum clean metadata) to delete associated metadata.
```

### DNF

------------
Just as with **yum** and **zypper**, **dnf** works with software repositories `(repos)`. Each distribution has a list 
of default repositories, and administrators can add or remove repos as needed.

To get a list of all available repositories, use `dnf repolist`. To list only **enabled** repositories, 
add the `--enabled` option, and to list only **disabled** repositories, add the `--disabled` option.
```editorconfig
# dnf repolist
repo id                                                                repo name
appstream                                                              AlmaLinux 9 - AppStream
baseos                                                                 AlmaLinux 9 - BaseOS
extras                                                                 AlmaLinux 9 - Extras
```
### To add a repository, use: 
```editorconfig
# dnf config-manager --add_repo URL
```
where URL is the full URL to the repository. 
### To enable a repository, use: 
```editorconfig
# dnf config-manager --set-enabled REPO_ID
```

### To disable a repository use:
```editorconfig
# dnf config-manager --set-disabled REPO_ID
```
In both cases **REPO_ID** is the unique ID for the repository, which you can get using `dnf repolist`. 
Added repositories are enabled by default.
Repositories are stored in .repo files in the directory `/etc/yum.repos.d/`, with exactly the same syntax used for **yum**.

### Zypper

`zypper` can also be used to manage software repositories. To see a **list** of all the repositories currently registered 
in your system, use `zypper repos`:
```editorconfig
# zypper repos
Repository priorities are without effect. All enabled repositories share the same priority.

#  | Alias                     | Name                               | Enabled | GPG Check | Refresh
---+---------------------------+------------------------------------+---------+-----------+--------
 1 | openSUSE-Leap-15.1-1      | openSUSE-Leap-15.1-1               | No      | ----      | ----
 2 | repo-debug                | Debug Repository                   | No      | ----      | --
```

See in the Enabled column that some repositories are enabled, while others are not. You can change this with 
the `modifyrepo` operator, followed by the `-e (enable)` or `-d (disable)` parameter and the repository 
alias (the second column in the output above).

```editorconfig
# zypper modifyrepo -d repo-non-oss
Repository 'repo-non-oss' has been successfully disabled.

# zypper modifyrepo -e repo-non-oss
Repository 'repo-non-oss' has been successfully enabled.
```
### Adding and Removing Repositories
To **add** a new software repository for zypper, use the `addrepo` operator followed by the repository
URL and repository name, like below:
```editorconfig
# zypper addrepo http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/ packman
Adding repository 'packman' ........................................[done]
Repository 'packman' successfully added

URI         : http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/
Enabled     : Yes
GPG Check   : Yes
Autorefresh : No
Priority    : 99 (default priority)

Repository priorities are without effect. All enabled repositories share the same priority.
```
While adding a repository, you can enable auto-updates with the `-f` parameter. Added repositories are **enabled** 
by default, but you can add and **disable** a repository at the same time by using the `-d` parameter.

To `remove` a repository, use the removerepo operator, followed by the repository name (Alias). 
```editorconfig
# zypper removerepo packman
Removing repository 'packman' ......................................[done]
Repository 'packman' has been removed.
```
