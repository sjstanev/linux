What is Arithmetic Expansion?
Arithmetic expansion in shell scripting allows you to perform arithmetic calculations directly within a script.

The syntax is:

bash
Copy code
$((expression))
$: Signals that the result of the arithmetic operation should be evaluated and returned.
((expression)): The parentheses enclose the arithmetic expression.
Why Use the $?
The dollar sign transforms the content inside ((...)) into a command that performs arithmetic, and the result is substituted back into the script. Without it, the shell won't treat the parentheses as an arithmetic evaluation.

Examples:
Correct Usage (with $):

bash
Copy code
result=$((5 + 3))
echo $result
Output:

Copy code
8
Explanation:

5 + 3 is evaluated inside $((...)).
The result, 8, is assigned to result.
Incorrect Usage (without $):

bash
Copy code
result=((5 + 3))  # Missing `$`
echo $result
Output:

bash
Copy code
((5 + 3))
Explanation:

Without $, the shell does not perform arithmetic.
Instead, ((5 + 3)) is treated as a string literal and assigned to result.
Key Points:
The $ tells the shell: "Perform arithmetic expansion here."
Arithmetic expressions include operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
Special Case: ((...)) Without $
If you write ((expression)) (without the $) in certain contexts, it works as a test condition but does not return a value.

Example:

bash
Copy code
if ((5 > 3)); then
  echo "True"
fi
Output:

graphql
Copy code
True
Explanation:

Here, ((5 > 3)) checks if 5 > 3 is true.
It doesn't need $ because it is used in a conditional context, not for expansion.
Summary:
Use $((...)) when you want to evaluate and expand an arithmetic expression.
Use ((...)) without $ when testing a condition (e.g., in if statements or loops).
